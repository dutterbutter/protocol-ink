## Dependencies
A prerequisite for compiling smart contracts is to have Rust and Cargo installed. Here's [an installation guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

We recommend installing [`cargo-contract`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract) as well.
It's a CLI tool which helps set up and manage WebAssembly smart contracts written with ink!:

```
cargo install cargo-contract --force
```

Use the `--force` to ensure you are updated to the most recent `cargo-contract` version.


## Compiling

- `npx redpost compile`

Or optionally for each contract:

- `cargo contract build`
## Testing 

- First ensure you have downloaded substrate contract node and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-contracts-node#download-binary)
- Then run `yarn install`.
- Then run `yarn build` to build all the contracts.
- Then run `yarn test`.
